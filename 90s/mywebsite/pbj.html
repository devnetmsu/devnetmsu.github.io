<h2>How to make a PB&amp;J</h2>

<h3>Acquiring Bread</h3>

First, you need to go the store to get some bread. Any kind of bread will do, but popular breads include white and wheat.<br>

<h3>Choosing Peanut Butter</h3>

Another crucial ingredient in the PB&amp;J is peanut butter. I prefer creamy, but some people prefer their peanut butter to be crunchy.<br>

<h3>Choosing Jelly</h3>

Most people prefer grape jelly, but depending on who will eat the sandwich, another flavor may also be appropriate.<br>
<br>
Be careful when deviating. In elementary school, I read a story where having the wrong kind of jelly was one of the criteria for classifying a day as "bad".<br>

<h3>Assembling the Sandwich</h3>

When making the PB&amp;J, it's important to have a good balance of peanut butter to jelly. Again, the perfect ratio depends on who will be eating the sandwich, and this requires some experimentation.<br>
<br>
<b>Building a full sandwich</b>
<br>
If you want a full meal (not counting desert), try going for a full sandwich.<br>
<br>
1. Using a butter knife, spread the peanut butter on one side of one piece of bread. Using a steak knife is optional, but not recommended.<br>
2. Using another butter knife, spread the jelly on one side of another piece of bread. Using the same knife from step 1 is acceptable but not recommended, as peanut butter may find its way into the jelly jar. If you want a lot of jelly, using a spoon is also acceptable.<br>
3. Put the pieces of bread together, so that the peanut butter and jelly make contact.<br>
4. Building a half sandwich<br>
<br>
<b>If you just want a snack, try half a sandwich.</b><br>
<br>
1. Using a butter knife, spread the peanut butter on half of one side of one piece of bread. Using a steak knife is optional, but not recommended. <br>
2. Using another butter knife, spread the jelly on the other half of the same side of the same piece of bread from step 1. Using the same knife from step 1 is acceptable but not recommended, as peanut butter may find its way into the jelly jar. If you want a lot of jelly, using a spoon is also acceptable.<br>
3. Fold the piece of bread in half along the peanut butter/jelly divide so that the peanut butter and jelly make contact.<br>
